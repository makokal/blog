I am currently at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) working on [IsaacSim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) after briefly spending time on the [DRIVE](https://developer.nvidia.com/drive) platform. 

Previously I was at [6 River Systems](http://6river.com) (a [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering) company) working on all things robotics for application in fulfillment. See some of the capability [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll9Z18fMBu4). Before that, I was at [Voyage Auto](http://voyage.auto) building decision making ingredients (behavior planning, predictions and remote discrete assistance) for autonomous driving, and even further before that, I was at [Apple SPG](https://www.apple.com) building autonomous systems. 

Prior to venturing into industry, I was an academic conducting research on normative navigation behaviors for mobile service robots at the [University of Freiburg](https://www.uni-freiburg.de) as part of my PhD studies.
In the more distant past, I have been fortunate to work in a number of labs including [DFKI](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html), the [Manipulation lab at RI-CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-area/manipulation-lab/), [TU-Munich](https://www.tum.de), [Idiap research institute](http://www.idiap.ch) among others.</p>

My main research interest is in sequential decision making for long term autonomy, and how it is applied to a number of AI tasks in various domains like robotics (e.g. self driving cars, mobile robots, drones), AI value alignment, intelligent behavior design, amongst others.

In my free time, I like to learn new things. I am currently learning the rust programming language.
